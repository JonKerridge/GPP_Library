Rationalise the way in which cloning is done using AutoClone

List2Net and NetInputs2List and also if multiple clusters Net2List
need to be incorporated into clusterBuilder.
NB the process definition for the two processes NI2L and N2L are
identical but their processing in cluster builder is very different.
L2N and N2L have identical sized input and output lists.
NI2L has an input list of nodes x cores inputs.
