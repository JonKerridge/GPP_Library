/**
 * The Cluster package is used only when the user wants to distributed a solution over a cluster of
 * distributed nodes connected by a TCP/IP network<p>
 *
 * The script RunHost has to be modified as required by the solution.  The script assumes that the
 * solution executes the emit and collector processes on the host node.<p>
 * The script RunNode must not be altered.  It just has to be run on each node that forms
 * part of the cluster that is not the host process.<p>
