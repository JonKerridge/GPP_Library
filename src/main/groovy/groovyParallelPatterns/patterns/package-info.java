/**
 * Package groovyParallelPatterns.patterns
 * defines processes that can be used as is simply by making appropriate reference to the data objects used
 * in the application.  The programmer is required to make no other changes.  As such the package patterns contains
 * some commonly occurring parallel structures.  On occasions programmers will need to create their own
 * parallel architectures as a response to the requirements of the application.<p>
 *
 * The application GPP_Demos.MCpi shows how the DataParallelPattern pattern is used with different combinations of data object.
 * The application GPP_Demos.Concordance shows how the TaskParallelPattern can be used, together with the other
 * patterns contained in this package.
