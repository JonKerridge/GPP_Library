/**
 * Package groovyParallelPatterns.terminals
 * defines processes that can used to emit initial data into
 * or collect data from the network.<p>
 *
 * Emit process types are the main processes that require knowledge
 * of the data object that is to be created.  Most other processes
 * do not need knowledge of the class that is being manipulated.
 * Other  processes that require such knowledge are in the package
 * groovyParallelPatterns.functionals.transformers. <p>
